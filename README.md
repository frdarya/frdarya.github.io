# About me
I'm a cognitive neuroscientist currently based at the [Laboratory for Clinical Neuroscience, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid](https://www.thestrangelab.org/), where I'm funded by a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie fellowship through the Spanish State Research Agency, Ministry of Science and Innovation and #NextGenerationEU.


I previously completed my PhD at the [Division of Neuroscience and Experimental Psychology, University of Manchester](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/facultiesandschools/division-of-neuroscience--experimental-psychology(56df8793-4074-4d32-b197-a40989cfefc7).html) and MSc at the [Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/).

# Research interests
I'm interested in the neurobiological mechanisms that make some events more memorable than others. To that end, I design cognitive tasks combined with functional MRI, intracranial EEG, and computational models to better understand how our memory system, orchestrated by the hippocampus, flexibily encodes information as a function of predictability and expectation.
