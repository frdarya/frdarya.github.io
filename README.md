# About me
I'm a cognitive neuroscientist currently based at the Laboratory for Clinical Neuroscience, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.
I previously completed my PhD at the Division of Neuroscience and Experimental Psychology, University of Manchester and MSc at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience UCL. You can see my full CV [here](frdarya.github.io/CV)

# Research interests
I'm interested in the neurobiological mechanisms that make some events more memorable than others. To that end, I design cognitive tasks combined with functional MRI, intracranial EEG, and computational models to better understand how our memory system, orchestrated by the hippocampus, flexibily encodes information as a function of predictability and expectation.
